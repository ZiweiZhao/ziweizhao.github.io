I finished my 3A this April. To me, it means that more than half of my univeristy trip has been completed. 

I took three CS courses: CS341 CS350 and CS370. I enjoyed 341, the algorithm course, the most. CS350 was about Operating Systems and it was a bit challenging since those content was quite new to me. CS370 talked about Numeric Computation and it was closer to a Math course. 

This term, I learnt how important time management was. With being a third year CS student, more interviews came than before while I was dealing with the midterms. I started to make plans and schedules. They were specific to when to get up and eat meals. The planning and management helped me a lot during the overwhelming days. 

Another improvement I made was that I was able to learn new materials faster than before. Thanks to all the practices and experience I gained, I picked up things faster with less pressure. It gave me a lot of confidence as well, which meant more to me than having a good grade.

I am looking forward to the following 3B term and ready to take more challenges. :)
