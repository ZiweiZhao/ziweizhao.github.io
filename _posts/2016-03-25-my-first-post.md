Composing my first blog on the train from Ottawa to Montreal, I feel excited about the new personal website build with Jekyll and host on github page.

This is my fourth year in Canada and second year at Uwaterloo. I had my high school in Delta, which locates in the Big Vancouver Area. I came to University of Waterloo for Computer Science after graduation. Currently I am half way through my coop term as an Software Engineer at Cisco System in Ottawa. 

Aritfically Intelligence initiates my passion towards Computer Science. Alpha Go is a hot topic recently. AI beats people in Go. Then will there be one day they beat us in more areas? Will there be one day they could feel things and have their own thoughts? What should us people do if they were developing out of control? (I might simply cut off the electricity for them haha.) 

Travelling is something I am excited about. I tavel a lot, either by my own or with family and friends. Sometimes I just need to keep myself out of the pool of codes. As right now on the train, I could relax myself and writing my first ever post for my site. It feels good and free. Maybe one day I could have my own AI to gather all the information and build a bug free travel plan for me. But this time, I wrote my own. We are going to have Lanzhou noodle at Chinatown in Montreal. Then we will walk around old Montreal and downtown area. It will be a wonderful afternoon to reunion with my best friends from high school.

This little site is intended to be my free land to post and write about ComSci, my life and things I am interested in. I would like to keep it simple and clean. Currently it doesn't support comments but you are more than welcome to email me or contact me through social media linked on the main page.
