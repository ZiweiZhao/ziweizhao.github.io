Finished my 2B term, also my first term at Computer Science in early August this year. It was such a heavy loaded term, but I enjoyed a lot. 

To begin with, I took five courses: CS 246 (Object-Oriented Software Development), CS240 (Data Stucture and Data Management), Math 239 (Introduction to Combinatorics), Math 237 (Calculus 3), Stat 230 (Probability). My favourite course among them is CS 246, which has the heaviest load. The last assignment was designing a OOP game stuctured with MVC from scratch. The course develop my coding skill so much that I gained not only the knowlege but also the confidence in writing qualified code. 

Besides, I have finally made the decision that I will have my second major in Statistics along with my favourite Computer Science. Machine learning interests me so much that I decide to learn more in the direction of data and statistics. That is one of my important turning points in my university life and I feel confident about that.

Another large part of my 2B term was the interviews. I got five interviews include Apple and Kik. The interviews are special experience to me. I noticed how much more I have to learn and explored which company I will fit in better. I end up with a Software Developer position at Flipp, a fast-growing company in Toronto, which is started by University of Waterloo alumni. The culture of the company interests me most. I will definitly write a following post with the reflection of the current Coop term at Flipp.

2B was a bittersweet term. Struggled a lot and enjoyed a lot. It makes my future more clear and makes me more determined with what I am doing. I am also looking forward to the rest of my university journey. :)
